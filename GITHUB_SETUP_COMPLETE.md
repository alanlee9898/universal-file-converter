# ðŸš€ Complete GitHub Setup Guide

## Your Project is Ready! 

âœ… **224 files** committed and ready to push  
âœ… **All configurations** updated with your GitHub username  
âœ… **Build system** configured for automatic releases  
âœ… **Documentation** and marketing materials complete  

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Sign in to GitHub
1. You're currently on the GitHub sign-in page
2. Enter your credentials:
   - Username: `alanlee9898` or `alanlee9898@gmail.com`
   - Password: Your GitHub password
3. Click "Sign in"

### Step 2: Create New Repository
After signing in:
1. Click the "+" icon in the top-right corner
2. Select "New repository"
3. Fill in the details:
   - **Repository name**: `universal-file-converter`
   - **Description**: `Privacy-first file conversion tool - convert files locally with desktop app support`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended for open source)
   - **Initialize**: Leave all checkboxes UNCHECKED (we have everything ready)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 3: Push Your Code
After creating the repository, GitHub will show you setup instructions. Use these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to your project (if not already there)
cd /home/code/file-converter

# Push to your new repository
git push -u origin main
```

If you get authentication errors, you have two options:

#### Option A: Personal Access Token (Recommended)
1. Go to GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Universal File Converter"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token and use it as your password when pushing

#### Option B: GitHub CLI
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI (if available)
gh auth login
# Follow the prompts to authenticate
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Create Your First Release
Once the code is pushed successfully:

```bash
# Create and push your first release
./release.sh 1.0.0
```

This will:
- Update package.json to version 1.0.0
- Create a git tag
- Push the tag to GitHub
- Trigger automatic builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
